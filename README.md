# Teacher-s-portal-web-development
A MongoDB and MySQL/postgresql project : To develop a teacher's portal for displaying their info/background(publication, courses taught etc.) to the public as well as a login for the teachers so that, not only can they update info on their personal page(Phase-B of project) but apply for leaves as well  via a leave portal(Phase-A of project)). Some of the faculty who login are those who have authority to approve/reject leave applications of other faculty members eg. HOD, Dean, Director. Other details regarding this project are specified in the 2 pdf files included
